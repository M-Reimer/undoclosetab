# webext-utils
Utilities that I use for my Mozilla Firefox Add-ons

Main repository for my utilities is: https://github.com/M-Reimer/webext-utils

This repository is included to most of my Add-ons as "utils" subtree.

This results in a unified set of utilities that are useful for more than one of my Add-ons. Not all of the utilities in this directory may be needed for a particular Add-on which includes this directory. Only the relevant ones are listed in the Add-on Makefile to be included into the final install package.
